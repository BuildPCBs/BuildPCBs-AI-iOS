## 🚀 What is BuildPCBs?

BuildPCBs is a revolutionary **AI + Web3 hardware creation network** that transforms how electronics are designed, manufactured, and sold. Imagine **Cursor or Replit, but for hardware and PCBs** — with gamification, decentralized manufacturing, and Web3 ownership.

### The Vision

Anyone can describe a device in plain text and our AI automatically generates:

- ✅ **PCB Design** (complete printed circuit board layout)
- ✅ **Schematic** (electrical circuit diagram)
- ✅ **BOM** (Bill of Materials with component sourcing)
- ✅ **Enclosure** (3D-printable case design)
- ✅ **Firmware Base** (embedded software starter code)
- ✅ **Manufacturing Instructions** (step-by-step production guide)

All created **inside BuildPCBs only**, with built-in EDA tools for editing and refinement.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🤖 AI Hardware Compiler

- **Natural Language → Physical Product**: Describe what you want, AI generates complete hardware
- **Intelligent Design**: AI acts as a hardware compiler, not just an assistant
- **Instant Iteration**: Chat with AI to refine and improve designs in real-time

### 🛠️ Built-in EDA Tools

- Edit PCBs, schematics, and layouts directly in the app
- Professional-grade design tools optimized for mobile
- Real-time validation and design rule checking

### 🏪 Closed Marketplace

- Publish and sell your BuildPCBs-generated hardware
- Curated platform for quality hardware products
- Built-in payment and fulfillment integration

### 🌐 Decentralized Manufacturing Network

- **Stake-to-Earn**: CNC operators, PCB fabricators, 3D printer owners, and builders stake **$BUILD tokens** to receive manufacturing jobs
- **Trustless Production**: Staking amount determines project value capacity
- **Global Network**: Access manufacturers worldwide

### ⛓️ Web3 Tracking & Ownership

- **On-chain Provenance**: All manufacturing steps logged on blockchain
- **Version Control**: Complete design history tracked permanently
- **IP Protection**: Ownership and licensing managed through smart contracts
